# NIST CSF Incident Response, DoS Attack Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a denial-of-service (DoS) attack that disrupted internal network services at a multimedia company. The incident is evaluated using the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF).

The project demonstrates how the NIST CSF core functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) can be applied to analyze a security incident and improve an organization’s security posture.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Incident response analysis
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) application
- Network attack identification (ICMP flood / DoS)
- Security control planning and improvement
- Incident documentation and communication
